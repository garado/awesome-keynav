# ⌨️ Keyboard navigation for AwesomeWM widgets

This library provides support for keyboard navigation within widgets. I use it in [my config](https://github.com/garado/cozy) and it works fairly well. Once it is complete (need to write documentation + tutorials and squash some bugs still), I hope fellow Vim enthusiasts will find it useful.
