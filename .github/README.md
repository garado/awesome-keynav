# ⌨️ Keynav
This is a library for making AwesomeWM widgets keyboard-navigable.

In my config, I have a [dashboard](https://github.com/garado/cozy) that has widgets... a lot of them. And I'm a Vim nerd so I need my keyboard navigation. I didn't like having to use the mouse to control my dashboard, so I made this out of sheer annoyance. I hope you find it useful!

## The basics
In order to make widgets keyboard navigable, you need to:
  1. specify how keys `interact` with the widget
  2. specify how keys `navigate` through the widget

To do this, the library consists of 3 parts:
- *Navitem*: defines how to interact with widgets
- *Area*: defines what widgets to navigate between
- *Navigator*: defines how to navigate between widgets

As this project is still in its very early stages and evolving very rapidly, documentation for it is not ready.
